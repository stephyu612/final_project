Title: Analyzing Biases in Election Polls 

The 2016 US Presidential election was characterized by numerous unepected results. Prior to election day, the majority of pollsters predicted a victory for Hillary Clinton. When Donald Trump was declared President, many questions were raisedabout the reliability and validity of pre-election polls. Here, we investigate these biases through comparisons across both national and state-level races since 2008.

Polling data collected from federal and state-level elections between 2008 - 2016 were organized into the elections_polls.RData file, which contains the data frame "polls". Standard statistical and data science R packages, such as ggplot2, diplyr, and tidyverse were used to quantify and visualize polling biases.

By critically examining biases in election polls, we aim to enhance the reliability and validity of future polling efforts. This project underscores the importance of rigorous methodology and transparency in the conduct of election polling, ultimately serving to improve our understanding of public opinion and electoral outcomes.
